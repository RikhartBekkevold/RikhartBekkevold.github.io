<!-- syntax highlight change that highlight only vue html attributes and values -->
<!-- ability to tab in my table component -->
<!-- set z index = index, set top: 0 for all of them  -->
<!-- drag expand sizes -->
<!-- pages displayed as minipages in rows and coloumns -->




QUESTIONS
why doesnt you need to add all the args it expects when calling a method?
calling a function that doesnt return anything does return undefined. setting a var to 2 returns 2. the assignment operator is a function?


TODO
//this will only work if last index != array length - 1 - adds visual feedback whats possible, and physical
//under it will aslong as index != 0
//same height on pages, or slightly lower top +, on lower pages? need to change which that is dynamically?
//only first page should have box shadow
//lock all pages to same height



CONSIDERATIONS
make formlist/pages global so every component can manipulate it?



//when making a framework. what do people not get about javascript?


access to a var is usually done globally i js. or comp need to change something else. or get it passed somehow.


utability shaped comps first?
make a list for yourself.


since js is immutable props only need to go down. not back up. events is only to tell of a chance in comp to outside that need to know to do something/interface/api.

ref example to get the element


//to make it easier they use undefined, that way they can set values someone misses, for example with entering args?
//do it like this. or add all of the differences through args, and set values that way



what happens if have both index.php and index.html in one folder?
