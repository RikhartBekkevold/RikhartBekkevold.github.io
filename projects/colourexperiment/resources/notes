variable called order, 1 or 0 that indicated which order the ncc/cc is in? just used the random variabled generated
need the total for ncc and cc, not total of all

if the diff is smaller compared to time they used overrall? rank them on skill based on the time they used to complete. if diff between ncc and cc decreases when
total time decreases.

then dont need their self evaluation

success (for each task) to see if the time they use is realistic

also determine, ask for colour blindness to make sure.

i'll use questionaree. to have many more people.

more colour
questionnare for more ppl
time for experience

use same principle as them for task equality

use diff

prep statement
mention its timed?

randomize

opacity to see behind
box shadow to be closer to you than other elements


what color is diff is not to important. but font, size, contrast etc might be.


help less or more if tired? might be relevant since it might mean low contrast is good

define criteria. make research to know what to do to fullfill the criteria.

individual comparison - their own group


teach them or mentally prepare them

since i dont care whether one task is harder than the other no need to ranomize task - tasks are not compared against eachother
randomize ncc, cc, fcc though


should i tell them its timed?


same task thrice is probably pretty tedious.

send research

serves as:
perfect size - can do upload and improve more and more
colour
web
interaction design
portfolio all in on
making packages and publish with npm
can make addons for atom

//total not that useful
//total for ncc and cc is critical though

// note it as weakness:
//didnt follow colour pricniples
//two different colour schemes


//research shows ncc and cc matters. now we test the effect on the amount of color. and we also compare to the experience, but we measure experience (as time)
// differently. with years as a backup.

//i can clean up and change the format of the data, as long as i have the data

//record in the data the order?

//if in doubt, make an assumption

//should the data show the randomization?
//will other data from eye tracker feks do that?

//write to two different files?

//randomized = secure for carry on effect? but cant analyze by seeing
//they did better for the first one, so cant be carry over effect...

//ask what to randomize

//learning effect between tasks dont matter?
//learning effect between ncc and cc though I need to account for

//randomizing everything... difine into categories...

//all are ncc first or vis versa

//if its not recorded, how do i know?
//if its the same, i know since i know which came first

//dont want to randomize everything sicne need more samples

//foo being called before function works

//when you think you have the answer

//monochrome is a very different. so is few vs many colours

//"also see if there are any difference between the syntax highlighters. not all equal feks. is monocrhome better? many colours? last is best, becasue
// looks at the aspect that actually should help. the words having colour. so..."


//since snipptes small, hard to have many colours

//does it help, and does the effct&/help increase with more colours (not experience)?

//more diff SH, more tests/tasks

//color. or light vs dark themes...

//mentally prepare them?

//monocrhome

//test in diff browsers

//does the nr of color matter? thats the qustiosn i ask
//so need theme where i can ask a question

//font


//randomizing tasks (pairs) doesnt matter since im not testing if some of them (the pairs) are harder or not
//randomizing ncc and cc make sure to see if there is a learning effect between


// 0 and 1.. can arrange on them
//kan rangere p√• "order" variable feks



high chroma = more vivid?
less chorma = bland?
