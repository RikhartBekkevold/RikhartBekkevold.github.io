-> desc_monster

== desc_monster 
//You sneak carefully through the forest. Between the trees. Listening for any sound as you go. You eventually reach a clearing, //and you see it. The monster. 

You peak over the edge of the rock, {ally_name} likewise, and assess the situation. 

In front of you stands /*or sleep*/ a huge creature, a few yards away. It becomes instantly clear to you why the reward was so unusually high. You have never seen a more threatening monster. It is hideous, large and with claw-like hands. Around its feet lay several dead goats, with claw marks on their sides. The remnants of its breakfast, no doubt. And, no doubt, taken from the village. You feel your knees weaken, but you tell yourself to get a grip. No turning back now. You've come too far.  

//time_of_day
//It's dark

Both you and {ally_name} stand and stare for a second, before regaining your senses.  
"So, whats the plan?" {ally_name} asks, visibly shaken at the sight of the hideous creature.

        The dwarf lunged at the beast. Axe in hand, striking repeatedly at the beast legs. 
        You attacked the other leg. 
    - else: 
        The elf lunged at the beast. Axe in hand, striking repeatedly at the beast legs.

* [Attack the same leg] 
    You both charge at the same leg. Hacking and slashing. 


* { ally_weapon == "bow" } [Distract it while {ally_name} shoots from a distance] 
    You distract the monster while. {ally_name} shoots arrows from a distance until it dies. 


* { time_of_day == "night" } [Sneak up on it] 
    You sneak up on the monster. You land a few blows, but the skin is too thick to cause serious damage. The monster awakens immedately, but at least you got some damage in before it could.

== the_inn 
CHAPTER 1 - THE INN 

You look around, taking in the sights of the room. It is a typical inn. It is filled with people. 

The inn is bustling with noise and movemement. Some people where sitting quitly, looking tired, having their breakfast. Others where merrily playing cards or talking to each other. A chatty bunch of dwarfs where sitting at a table close to you. In the corner across the room a solitary hooded figure sipped on a mug. The innkeeper, behind his table, where cleaning a similar looking mug. The meek looking girl was serving a gnome sitting by himself.  
-> INFO

== INFO
Before you left the inn on your way to look for the beast you figured that you better ask around for some information. It never hurt to gather information first. Besides, you need to figure out the location of the village mentioned in the announcement. Perhaps someone in the inn would know.

-> town_description

== your_room_1
You wake up. Next to the bed, on the night stand, lies a piece of parchement. You pick it up and read it, like you have so many times before. It reads: 
* [Next] -> your_room_2 

== your_room_2
"The King herby offers the reward of 200 gold for the head of the beast know as 'Shadowfang'. Bring the head of the beast to the Guard. Head must be in condition to identify by. The beast was last seen around the village of Mournstead"
* [Next]  -> your_room_3 

== your_room_3
You fold the parchment back and stand up. Despite the words, you know this declaration, although simple, means more to you than the 200 gold. It offers you a chance to restore you honor, and your reputation. And for this reason, successfully slaying the beast matters more to you than some earthly gold.  
* [Next] -> weapon_choices 

== weapon_choices
You can hear the merry talk of the inn below you. You dress yourself. Before you head downstair you also grab your:

// can create the variable now, then dont have to replace value 
// one option = next/progress story






you have a burning desire
you stayed here after arriving last night?
make it feel like what yoyu choose will determine the end? 
during battle, read the variable to decide the pronoun and the battle tactics? 
weapons are for battle, therefore fits in the battle tactics section 
the importance of making choices ambiguous - all attractive to some 
the choice shouldnt be leading. should be about the players actual preference.
dont need to explain why its important to you? just make sure it is 
restore ytour honor and reputation - these contract means more to you than the gold, you know this. 
when choosing go into mem/variable, not branching
impress the importance of the journey to the player. "you have to do this"

npcs informs you of this?
forest or road - faster safer - give good reasosn for both, argue well for both, makes it hard
to - make good, retional case for both. make you reall 

not important to make player take a stand on issues 
it more fun when they just choose cool things 
"intervene?" 

write about something you know
easier to fall back to something 
read withcer books for language tips
humor
myself passionate and angry
this format/standard rpg tasks and choices makes it more applicalbe to rpghs? generalizxale valid
iterate - rewrite
keep it simple, add detail later 
dividing is the key to clearity and order 
they can't decide my life how much they try. only I can. 
mystery. make squest clear, but have some qustions open? make the player wonder?


talk about the design. you are mixd
more about the design, then the coding since mixd - different prototype versons?

make choices hard 
make choices represent player personality/preference

fun = 
picking up items, getting stronger, getting answers to questions

they call me samael
personality, character - "he rapped out"

choose who to talk to 
choose how to get there - path  
choose the order of things 
choose which class to be 
choose the gear and weapon, preference basically, class/plkaystlye preference
other rpg choices you would make 

the dwarf theme is something they are familiar with 


third wall
humor
varied language



THE TOWN OF Vir Doruhl, year 1202 
following trail with the clues you got .. you choose who to talk to, you choose who to ally, you choose which weapong and armor to pick up (aka class). feks "you put on the leather, after all, its best to be agile." you choose to buy items. you choose to talk to ppl whhich makes you notice things later. you choose who to side with in the on going conflict in the city:

The town of Vir Doruhl was an ancient dwarf town that was situated up against a mountain wall, where the dwarfs had been mining for centuries, and was indeed the original reasons for its construction.

the intro is like character select - should you choose partner? - trad. rpg

make it clear that decisions now will affect what you can do later. 

rpg, npc both dialog, and playstlye and help or not

reading takes time 
making decisions that are hard, takes time 
iterated content takes time 
replayability takes time 

what makes hard choice: 
obvious flaw with both - equllity 
ambiguity 

ask for where the village. not the monster is 

//== fight
  //  bhmbbnma
  // repeatedly slash until the health is at bottom 
  // reward for fighting? 

==  bonfire 

    You decide to set up camp for the night.

    How old are you

next changed to move on? 

You weak legs do not allow to do that move 
You tried to cut, but your current health is {player_current_health} so your swing is weak and the {player_weapon} won't cut very deep. 

generic, repeating fights in the middle? so can use battling? to extend journey. 
more convo with partner

Search the ground?
You find noithing (luck++`?). You find 5 coins.


there needs to be a qustion in players head that want to be answered by playing the gmae/story. the ending has a twist. or the answer. if twist it needs to be "obiovus the outcome", as journey goes along

THE VILLAGE OF MOURNSTEAD #CLASS: test 

At dawn you arrive at the quaint little village of Mournstead. There is no one around except an old man hurrying across the street. You talk to the sole villager. 
-> old_man
== old_man
    //* [Ask the man for vendors] 
    * [Ask the man where everyone is]  
        "Inside" the man answers. 
        "With the current monster roaming about, it's not safe outside at night" he finishes. -> old_man
    * [Ask about the monsters location] 
        The elderly man points towards the west, at a cave far in the distance. -> old_man
    * ->  // this gets triggered when no options left? when all options exhausted, move on..
    - // loop here?  it only works once because no fall back=?
    
    // - after each would create the same result? 
    
    // if + dont need fall back... but with * i do? so it know what to do when list is over? because error is after last 
    // option is done?
    
    // its not good to divert at end, because its infinte loop? fallback must always be - or lead to new knot?
    
    // one goes back, the others move on? 
    // find out where monster last seen from NPC to move on. mark it with some red or something? "mission"
    
It's late, the sun is setting. 
"Should we stay and rest until the morning, or go now in the dark?" {ally_name} asks you.
    * [Move on]
        You decide it's best to move now. Maybe the darkness can be used to your advantage.   
        ~ time_of_day = "night" 
    * [Stay and Rest] 
        ** [Rent a room at the local inn (50 gold)]
            { 
                - player_gold < 50:
                    You don't have enough money to rent a room. 
                - else:
                    ~ player_gold -= 50
                    You rent a room for the night. You now have {player_gold} gold left.
                    The next morning you feel rested.  
            }  
        ** [Sleep outside] 
            You sleep outside on the hard ground.
            The next morning you don't feel very rested.  
        --
        // something after move on 
    -
     Your party of two set foot in the direction of west, towards the cave.
     After an hour you reach the goal. You crouch behind a rock. 
    * [Next]
-> the_battle





make stanard functions? for talking to NPC? and battle.

//back at where you left off    
    
    
   


make a deal to get the points before presentation? or do i not need, just cant recieve imidately? 
if i admit didnt know, and go to them, after a while, they can fix work aroudn that? knowing my situation.
i probably could have forced myself. so annoying.
he has time nopw obviously.
see on studentweb, not homepage.
can discuss the problem without him. can continue working. dont know if i cant continue.
may take a long time? i am not priority. can take long before sign contract.
more forgiving if i have worked for a long time.
if he cant next semester. no one else can take his place. only he knows games. 
can always work alone tbh. can manage now? statistic analysis   

choose own adv. and gameplay. 
NPC needs to act in convo and battle.
and after you are hurt, it might do something? 


gameplay, story choices 

NPC involvment and differences 

its fairly versatile. it's just a journey. but need ideas for NPC involvement and potential for 
differetions.  


----The game design----
the design of the game NPC wise

the game was designed, like a traditional NPC.
this allowed the NPC to express differences in 3 main ways. through actions. eg. how they fight.
thoruh how they respond to events. and help player.
through dialog. how they answered the players question. 
through the creation of the character itself. character creation.

the game had 1 battle for action. 
- explain in detail how the game is designed for different PT actcions. they need to perform same actions?
for control of variables? cant be wastly different. just different in the ways that is neccessary to 
express difference. but they still need to abide the same game rules? 
the char creation allowed to customize the preferences of players. 
How we describe the looks of the NPC feks? and then playstyle.. like bow, and "defensive player/agressive" 
and her stats.
other rpg games has this aswell, but not automated. 


the witcher choices. have buy ikon in front of some options. 

"model the NPC" which then really tells us how they would act in the situations we have created/the game
creates.

story isolated. should have done alone. then model NPC. and also create the game with it's action.
he did mentioned choices. for moving forward that is..?
you can only ask one quesion out of your curiosity
elaborate  char creation build an rpg profile  - automatic so no need for many questiosns
give it to me. do not give it to me.  yes or no starts  small weave
recruit ppl along way for final battle.
pay for inbformation
use charms
make money useful inthe game
make story more meaningful
the villagerrs are vampires too. the monter was a trap to lure mercenaries for blood. learn during sleepover.
 talking to ppl for  clues is the journey

gameplay:
loot
char creation. change this.
find information/talk to ppl
exhaust all options forced - old man  
by stuff for inventory
go back
replace weaponm
choose path/action

export to wesbite where i can incoropote automated cration based on pt test?
need ideas for npc action
