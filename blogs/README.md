json api request file in folder. then insert returned text in .article innerhtml when load
when we load "page"/component, we do this

request script which get from db the text? firebase upload. must be prgramaticall/gui?
if i just add here in folder it dont.

website IS server. dont need to run backend code/backend server/php scripts.

server with public files and your own files. still need to send requests, but easier to hvae all in one place.
using servers or own decidated server works too. no reason they should be the same public/server/private.

when upload it to server (need server for api reqest) we can remove and format the md into a html doc string, or
make sure that a span less pre code is added? or add the language attriutes etc that prim/me uses? we can run the
code of this file in node to perma change it to add the spans? then i dont need to

upload
save as js text/json here, then just
when click, get name of link, and use it to load the file, since cant read text files, need to be js?

these files is on server when we upload! dont need external/additonal server, we can requst our own page in this folder. just cant run php/node script.
but can read .json/js/html files that are uploaded (aslong as ext allows us)
dont work locally here, but does when we upload
the files in tutorials wont be loaded when we access this page. just lays on server until we request.

check to load from url, type it. then fix the link after.
pain to test if need upload - dummy php server? for testing

backup: save as js string in afile and link in tutorials.html at end, thenload the one that matches name

add id/name of html file to link and when we click we add the data to url and read it again here to load correct

must be a node - md to html api/lib?

      hl certain projects and make others smaller
      on frontpage? 
json = {
  name: urlname
  text: ``?""
}

now its an idependant site, that passes info with url
but still are only one page for each document. instead of copying a html template oducment for each blog.
like a video requesting db video page on youtube or twitch.

two diff pages/compo, but still same menu etc

how to deal with nav? links to main page, and add hash for leading correct? aka, url to ../index.html#hash or just default same page?
not click event then?
in vue compo we decide which page to load on init?

// run it as a cmd - to transform to
// same cmd that remov s spans?


we cant send request to script - since req backkend
but we can send request to file directly. to read a file directly. just cant run scripts. (aka ask node script for files in folder)

when click blog link. replace the content with fetch result? same as would happen after when to new page. just immediately instead.
witout going to new page and reading url and adding the url data to fetch requst. easier for others to link that way thouhg? since
we need to mani url anyway.

manually add:?
